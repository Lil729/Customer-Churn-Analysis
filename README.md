📈 Analyzing 7,000+ Telco customers to predict churn and support business retention strategies.

📊 This project simulates a real-world churn analysis for a subscription-based telecom company. The goal is to identify churn drivers, track key metrics, and help reduce customer attrition. Built using Excel and Power BI.

### 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze customer behavior and uncover why users leave the service (“churn”), so the business can take action. The dashboard answers:

- What contract types are linked to high churn?
- Are older customers more loyal?
- How does monthly cost affect churn rate?
- Which segments are most at risk?
